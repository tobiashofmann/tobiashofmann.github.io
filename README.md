# SAP Keynote buzzword bingo

## Description

Keynotes are great as companies show the latest and greatest and what game changing products to expect in the weeks to come. Company keynote can costs a tremendous amount of money, employ a wide range of people, are are meticulously planned and ... scripted. So, yes, Keynotes can be boring too. It is the nature of a keynote to not be a stand up comedy show. Not every speaker is a good presenter, knows how to use the stage and can work with the audience. Nothing that hinders companies to go through lenghty keynotes. Some keynotes are better than others, some not, some are just boring.

A keynote should never bore people. A key topic that SAP sometimes ignores. In fact, SAP worked hard over the last years to not only be the leader in ERP software, but to also be earn a top position of the list of boring keynotes. But there is hope. SAP keynotes are hidden gems. Throwing in suprising references to hyped technologies or topics no one thinks are of interest: it can all happen in just one single keynote featuring an SAP top executive.

Therefore, every SAP keynote is not intended to be watched passively. Every word and sentence is made to be penetrated by the listeners, to be analyzed and be used to transform a persons to a new level of being: the SAP Ãœbermensch.

# How to play

This app is made to help you in this journey. Inspired by the classical buzzword bingo, it shows a list of words that may be part of a typical SAP keynote. The app showls a set of words on a grid. If a word shown there is mentioned by the SAP speaker, mark it. If you are the first get all words in a row / column, scream Quantencomputing (or Bingo). If you are the first person, you win. If not, use the app to continue your deep dive into the wisdom shared by SAP in the keynote.

If the selected words seem to odd to be part of the keynote (ha!) you can click on the reload button to get a new list of words.

The app is currently loaded with English and German words as the next time I am going to play it is at the [DSAG Technologietage 2023 in Mannheim](https://dsag.de/events/).

# Contributing

If you want to contribute buzzwords: the file ./models/.buzzwords.json is the JSON you are looking for. Just add your buzzword(s) as key:value:

```json

_Take care of the comma at the end. Last position in the json file: no comma please._

# Fun, not fun?

An app like this really helps to stay focus. You will listen more carefully to the speaker(s) while trying to find out if a listed word is in the keynote text or not. The more tiles you turn blue, the more you'll get excited and follow even more closely the keynote. This really can help to transform a passive 30 to 90 minutes lecture into an entertaining pleasure.
